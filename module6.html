                        <h3>What are AI-Generated Content?</h3>
                        <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) can now create content that looks, sounds, or reads like it was made by humans. This includes:</p>
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>AI-Generated Images:</strong> Photos of people, places, or things that don't actually exist</li>
                            <li><strong>AI-Generated Text:</strong> Articles, stories, or messages written by AI</li>
                            <li><strong>AI-Generated Voices:</strong> Audio that sounds like a specific person but was created by AI</li>
                            <li><strong>AI-Generated Videos:</strong> Videos showing events that never happened or people saying things they never said</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>These technologies are improving rapidly, making it increasingly difficult to distinguish between real and AI-generated content.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="module-section">
                        <h3>Why AI-Generated Content Can Be Dangerous</h3>
                        <p>While AI has many positive uses, it can also be misused to spread misinformation in convincing ways:</p>
                        
                        <div class="warning">
                            <h4>Potential Risks:</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Voice Scams:</strong> Scammers can use AI to mimic the voice of a loved one calling for emergency money</li>
                                <li><strong>Fake News:</strong> Creating realistic but completely fabricated news articles or photos</li>
                                <li><strong>False Videos:</strong> Making it appear that public figures said things they never actually said</li>
                                <li><strong>Impersonation:</strong> Creating fake profiles with AI-generated photos to build false relationships</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                        
                        <p>These technologies make it more important than ever to verify information from multiple trusted sources.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="module-section">
                        <h3>How to Question What You See and Hear</h3>
                        <p>With AI-generated content becoming more common, it's important to develop a healthy skepticism about what you encounter online:</p>
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Consider the source:</strong> Is it from a reputable news organization or website?</li>
                            <li><strong>Look for verification:</strong> Is the same information reported by multiple trusted sources?</li>
                            <li><strong>Check for context:</strong> Is there important information missing that would change your understanding?</li>
                            <li><strong>Be alert for emotional manipulation:</strong> Does the content seem designed primarily to make you angry or fearful?</li>
                            <li><strong>Watch for unusual timing:</strong> Does the information appear just before an important event or election?</li>
                            <li><strong>Trust your instincts:</strong> If something seems off, it's worth investigating further.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Tools to Detect AI-Generated Content</h3>
                        <p>While no detection method is perfect, there are some tools and techniques that can help identify AI-generated content:</p>
                        
                        <div class="example">
                            <h4>For Images:</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Look closely at details:</strong> AI often struggles with fingers, teeth, earrings, glasses, and text within images</li>
                                <li><strong>Check for unnatural backgrounds:</strong> Sometimes backgrounds have strange distortions or inconsistent blurring</li>
                                <li><strong>Reverse image search:</strong> Use Google Images to see if the image appears elsewhere online</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                        
                        <div class="example">
                            <h4>For Text:</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Check for generic language:</strong> AI writing often lacks specific details and personal touches</li>
                                <li><strong>Look for repetitive phrases:</strong> AI may repeat similar phrases or ideas throughout a text</li>
                                <li><strong>Be suspicious of perfectly error-free text:</strong> Human writing typically contains some small errors or personal quirks</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                        
                        <div class="example">
                            <h4>For Audio/Video:</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Watch for unnatural movements:</strong> Especially around the mouth, eyes, or hand gestures</li>
                                <li><strong>Listen for unusual voice patterns:</strong> Changes in tone, unnatural pauses, or background noise that cuts in and out</li>
                                <li><strong>Look for inconsistencies:</strong> Like lighting that changes oddly or elements that appear and disappear</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                        
                        <p>Remember that detection technology is constantly improving, but so is the technology used to create AI content.</p>
