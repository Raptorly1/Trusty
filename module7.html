                        <h3>Keep Your Software and Devices Updated</h3>
                        <p>One of the simplest but most important things you can do to stay safe online is to keep your devices and software updated. Here's why:</p>
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li>Updates often contain security fixes for newly discovered vulnerabilities</li>
                            <li>Outdated software may have security flaws that hackers can exploit</li>
                            <li>Updates can also improve performance and add new features</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <div class="example">
                            <h4>How to Keep Your Devices Updated:</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>For smartphones (iPhone):</strong> Go to Settings > General > Software Update</li>
                                <li><strong>For smartphones (Android):</strong> Go to Settings > System > System update or Software update</li>
                                <li><strong>For Windows computers:</strong> Click Start > Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update</li>
                                <li><strong>For Mac computers:</strong> Click Apple menu > System Preferences > Software Update</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                        
                        <p>Many devices can be set to update automatically, which is usually the safest option. If you're not sure how to update your device, ask a trusted family member or friend for help.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="module-section">
                        <h3>Don't Download Random Apps</h3>
                        <p>Apps can access a lot of information on your device, including your contacts, location, photos, and sometimes even your microphone and camera. Be selective about which apps you download.</p>
                        
                        <div class="warning">
                            <h4>App Safety Tips:</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Only download apps from official sources (Apple App Store, Google Play Store)</li>
                                <li>Check the app's ratings and reviews before downloading</li>
                                <li>Look at how many people have downloaded it (more downloads usually means it's more trustworthy)</li>
                                <li>Check what permissions the app is requesting—does a simple game really need access to your contacts?</li>
                                <li>Be especially careful with free apps that seem too good to be true</li>
                                <li>Regularly review and remove apps you no longer use</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                        
                        <p>Remember: Even legitimate-looking apps can contain malware or collect excessive amounts of personal data.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="module-section">
                        <h3>Don't Give Passwords to Anyone</h3>
                        <p>Your passwords should be private—they're like the keys to your digital home. No legitimate company or service will ever call you and ask for your password.</p>
                        
                        <div class="warning">
                            <h4>Important Password Safety Rules:</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Never tell anyone your passwords, even friends or family members</li>
                                <li>No legitimate tech support person will ever ask for your password</li>
                                <li>Don't enter your passwords on websites that don't look secure (no https:// or padlock icon)</li>
                                <li>Be careful about entering passwords on public computers or when using public Wi-Fi</li>
                                <li>If someone claims they need your password to help you, it's almost certainly a scam</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                        
                        <p>If you need help with your computer or online accounts, there are ways for tech support to assist you without knowing your password.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="module-section">
                        <h3>Be Skeptical of Urgency</h3>
                        <p>One of the most common tactics scammers use is creating a false sense of urgency to pressure you into acting quickly without thinking.</p>
                        
                        <div class="example">
                            <h4>Common Urgency Tactics:</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>"Your account will be closed if you don't respond within 24 hours"</li>
                                <li>"You've been charged $499—call immediately to dispute"</li>
                                <li>"Click here now to claim your prize before time runs out"</li>
                                <li>"This is your final notice before legal action is taken"</li>
                                <li>"You must verify your information now or lose access"</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                        
                        <p>Remember this important rule: If someone is trying to rush you into making a decision or taking action, that's a red flag. Legitimate companies generally give you time to respond and don't use threatening language.</p>
                        
                        <h4>What to do when faced with urgent messages:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Take a deep breath and pause</li>
                            <li>Contact the company directly using their official phone number or website (not the contact information in the urgent message)</li>
                            <li>Ask a trusted friend or family member for advice before taking action</li>
                            <li>Remember that most problems can wait at least 24 hours for you to verify the situation</li>
                        </ul>
