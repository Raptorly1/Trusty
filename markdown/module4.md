# Module 4: Safe Browsing & Websites

## What Makes a Website Safe?

When browsing the internet, it's important to recognize which websites are safe to use and which might put your information at risk. Here's what you need to know:

## Secure Website Indicators

### Look for HTTPS and the Lock Symbol

When visiting a website, look at the address bar at the top of your browser. Safe websites will have:

- **https://** at the beginning of the web address (not just http://)
- A **lock icon** next to the web address

<div class="example-image">
    [Example of a secure website with HTTPS and lock icon]
    <p class="caption">A secure website showing the lock icon and HTTPS</p>
</div>

This means the website uses encryption to protect your information.

## How to Check if a Website is Real

Be cautious of websites that:

- Have **strange spellings** of familiar company names (like "Amaz0n.com" or "Face-book.net")
- Have **unusual domain endings** (like ".co" instead of ".com" for American businesses)
- Look like familiar websites but have a **different web address**
- Contain **many grammatical errors** or **poor design**

### Try This Test

Look at these two website addresses. Which one is real?
- www.bankofamerica.com
- www.bank-of-america.co

The first one is the real Bank of America website. The second is a fake site trying to trick you.

## Avoiding Sketchy Ads and Links

### Be Careful With Ads

Many ads are legitimate, but some can lead to harmful websites. Be careful of ads that:

- Promise **unrealistic things** ("You've won $10,000!")
- Create a sense of **urgency** ("Claim now - offer expires in 5 minutes!")
- Ask you to **download something**
- Look **unusual or flashy** with lots of bright colors and animations

### Safe Clicking

- **Hover** your mouse over a link to see where it will take you before clicking
- Look at the bottom of your browser to see the real destination
- If a link looks suspicious, **don't click it**
- When in doubt, go directly to a website by typing the address in your browser

## Pop-ups and Malware Tricks

### Common Pop-up Tricks

Be wary of pop-up windows that say things like:
- "Your computer is infected!"
- "Your system is running slow!"
- "Update your Flash player now!"

These are usually scams trying to get you to download harmful software.

### How to Handle Pop-ups

- **Never** click inside a suspicious pop-up
- Use the **X** in the corner to close it, or close your browser completely
- If pop-ups won't stop, restart your device

## Interactive Activity: Choose the Safe Website

<div class="quiz-container">
    <p>Look at these website examples and click on the one you think is safe:</p>
    
    <div class="quiz-option" data-correct="true">
        <img src="images/real-website.jpg" alt="Example of a legitimate website" />
        <p>Website with https, lock symbol, professional design, clear contact information</p>
    </div>
    <div class="quiz-option" data-correct="false">
        <img src="images/fake-website.jpg" alt="Example of a suspicious website" />
        <p>Website with http only, no lock, spelling errors, unusual web address</p>
    </div>
    <div class="feedback"></div>
</div>

## Key Takeaways

- Look for HTTPS and the lock icon
- Check web addresses carefully
- Be suspicious of urgent offers or too-good-to-be-true promises
- Avoid clicking on pop-ups that warn about computer problems
- When in doubt, type the website address directly into your browser
