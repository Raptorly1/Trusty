Clara uses her phone to read the news and look at pictures of her grandkids. One morning, she got a text message that looked like it came from her bank. It said her account was locked and told her to click a link.

## Well, what could possibly go wrong?

Clara wasn't sure what to do. The message looked real, and it made her worried. She almost clicked the link, but decided to show her son first.

Her son looked at the message and gently said, "Mom, I'm really glad you asked. This is a scam. The bank would never text you like that."

- Losing money
