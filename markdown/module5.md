# Module 5: Passwords & Privacy

## Protecting Your Digital Life

Your passwords are the keys to your digital life. Just like you wouldn't leave your house key under the doormat, you need to keep your passwords safe and secure.

## Why Strong Passwords Matter

Weak passwords are like weak locks - they're easy for criminals to break through. Here's why strong passwords are important:

- They protect your personal information
- They keep your accounts from being hacked
- They prevent others from pretending to be you online
- They safeguard your money and important documents

## What Makes a Password Weak?

Many people use passwords that are easy to guess. Avoid passwords that:

- Use personal information (your name, birthdate, etc.)
- Use common words like "password" or "welcome"
- Use simple patterns like "123456" or "qwerty"
- Are very short (less than 8 characters)
- Are used for multiple accounts

## Creating Strong but Memorable Passwords

A good password should be:
- **At least 12 characters long**
- **A mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols**
- **Not a common word or phrase**
- **Different for each important account**

### The Phrase Method

One of the easiest ways to create a strong password is to use a phrase you'll remember, then modify it:

1. Think of a phrase or sentence: "I love watching birds at my feeder!"
2. Use the first letter of each word: "Ilwbamf!"
3. Add numbers and symbols: "Ilwbamf!2023"
4. Mix in some capital letters: "IlWbAmF!2023"

This creates a password that's hard for others to guess but easier for you to remember.

## What Not to Share Online

To protect yourself online, be careful about sharing:

- Your full birthdate (especially the year)
- Your home address
- Your phone number
- Vacation plans (announcing when you'll be away from home)
- Photos that show where you live
- Financial information
- Password reset answers (like your mother's maiden name)

## Password Managers: A Helpful Tool

    <h3>What is a Password Manager?</h3>
    <p>A password manager is a secure app that stores all your passwords in one place. It's like a digital safe for your passwords.</p>
</div>

Benefits of using a password manager:
- You only need to remember one master password
- It can generate strong passwords for you
- It automatically fills in your passwords on websites
- Your passwords are encrypted (scrambled) for security

Some recommended password managers:
- **Bitwarden** (free and very secure)
- **LastPass** (easy to use)
- **1Password** (good for families)

### If You Prefer Not to Use a Password Manager

If you're not ready for a password manager, consider:
1. Writing passwords in a notebook kept in a safe place at home
2. Using different passwords for important accounts (email, banking)
3. Updating passwords regularly (every 6-12 months)
