# Module 7: Cyber Hygiene Habits

## Keeping Your Digital Life Clean and Healthy

Just like regular health check-ups help keep your body healthy, good "cyber hygiene" habits help keep your digital life safe and secure.

## Keep Your Software and Devices Updated

### Why Updates Matter

Software updates aren't just about new featuresâ€”they often fix security problems that hackers know about.

    <p><strong>Think of it this way:</strong> If your house had a broken lock, you'd fix it right away. Software updates are like fixing digital locks that protect your information.</p>

### How to Keep Updated

#### On a Computer:
- **Windows**: Click on Start > Settings > Update & Security
- **Mac**: Click on Apple menu > System Preferences > Software Update

#### On a Phone or Tablet:
- **iPhone/iPad**: Settings > General > Software Update
- **Android**: Settings > System > System Update or Settings > About Phone > System Updates

### Set Up Automatic Updates

The easiest way to stay protected is to turn on automatic updates:
- On most devices, find this in Settings
- Choose to update automatically when connected to Wi-Fi
- Set updates to install overnight when you're not using your device

## Be Careful with App Downloads

### Only Download from Official Sources

For phones and tablets:
- **Apple devices**: Apple App Store
- **Android devices**: Google Play Store

For computers:
- Use official websites of the software company
- Avoid downloading from pop-up ads or unfamiliar websites

### Check Before You Download

Before downloading any app, check:
- **Who made it?** (Is it from a company you recognize?)
- **Reviews** (What do other users say?)
- **Permissions** (Why does a calculator app need access to your contacts?)

## Don't Share Your Passwords

### Keep Passwords Private

- **Never share passwords** with anyone who contacts you
- Legitimate companies **will never ask** for your full password
- Even family members should have their own accounts when possible
- If you must share a password, change it afterward

### Watch Out for "Shoulder Surfing"

Be aware of people watching as you enter passwords in public places.

## Be Skeptical of Urgency

### The "Urgency Trick"

Scammers often create a false sense of emergency to make you act quickly without thinking.

Be suspicious when:
- Messages claim your account will be **closed immediately**
- Someone says they need money **right now**
- You're told there's a **limited time** to claim a prize
- You're warned about **immediate arrest** or legal problems

### The "Wait and Verify" Rule

When faced with urgent requests:
1. Take a deep breath
2. Tell yourself it's okay to pause
3. Contact the company or person through official channels
4. Verify the situation before taking any action

## Create a Digital Safety Cheat Sheet

### Make Your Own Reminder Sheet

                <label for="check4">Is this request unusual or suspicious?</label>
            </div>
            <div class="checklist-item">
                <input type="checkbox" id="check5" />
                <label for="check5">Should I verify this with a direct phone call?</label>
