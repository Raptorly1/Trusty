# Module 3: Spotting Fake News & Deepfakes

## What is Fake News?

"Fake news" refers to false or misleading information presented as legitimate news. It can spread quickly on social media and sometimes looks very real. Learning to spot fake news is an important skill in today's digital world.

## Why Fake News is a Problem

- It can cause people to make decisions based on incorrect information
- It can damage trust in legitimate news sources
- It can create unnecessary fear or anger
- It can influence political opinions unfairly

## How to Identify Fake News

### Check the Source

- Is it from a well-known, reputable news organization?
- Does the website look professional, or does it have lots of ads and popup windows?
- Check the URL (web address) – fake news sites often use URLs that mimic legitimate news sites but with slight differences

### Read Beyond the Headline

Headlines are designed to get attention and clicks. Always read the full article before sharing.

### Check the Author

- Is the author a real person?
- Can you find other articles by this author?
- Do they have relevant credentials or expertise?

### Check the Date

Old news stories sometimes recirculate as if they're new. Always check when an article was published.

### Check Supporting Sources

- Does the article cite its sources?
- Are those sources credible?
- Can you verify the information from other reputable sources?

### Check Your Biases

We're all more likely to believe news that confirms what we already think. Be extra careful when you see something that perfectly matches your existing opinions.

## What are Deepfakes?

Deepfakes are videos, images, or audio recordings that have been digitally manipulated to make it appear that someone is saying or doing something they never actually did. 

Advanced artificial intelligence technology makes it possible to create very convincing fake content that can be hard to distinguish from reality.

## How to Spot Deepfakes

### Watch for Visual Clues

- Unnatural eye movements or blinking patterns
- Skin tone that changes oddly
- Blurry or changing facial features
- Awkward head movements

### Listen for Audio Clues

- Unnatural speech patterns or breathing
- Inconsistent voice tone
- Background noise that cuts in and out

### Use Common Sense

- Does the person in the video or audio seem to be saying things that are out of character?
- Would this person really be in this situation?
- Is this being reported by multiple reliable news sources?

## Tools for Verification

There are several tools and websites that can help you verify news stories:

- **Google Search** – Search for the story to see if multiple reputable sources are reporting it
- **Snopes.com** – A fact-checking website dedicated to debunking rumors and misinformation
- **FactCheck.org** – Monitors political claims and statements
- **Reuters Fact Check** – Investigates and debunks misinformation
