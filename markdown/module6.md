# Module 6: AI & Misinformation

## Understanding AI-Generated Content

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is changing our digital world rapidly. While AI brings many benefits, it also creates new challenges for telling what's real online.

## What is AI-Generated Content?

AI can now create very realistic:
- **Text**: Articles, stories, and social media posts that sound human-written
- **Images**: Photos of people, places, or events that never existed
- **Audio**: Voice recordings that sound exactly like real people
- **Video**: "Deepfakes" that show people saying or doing things they never did

<div class="example-box">
    <h3>Example: AI-Generated Image</h3>
    <div class="comparison">
        <div class="example-item">
            <img src="images/ai-image-example.jpg" alt="AI-generated portrait of a person who doesn't exist" />
            <p>This person looks real but was created entirely by AI.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

## Why AI-Generated Content Can Be Dangerous

AI content can be used to:
- Spread **false information**
- Create **convincing scams**
- **Impersonate** people you trust
- Make **fake evidence** of events that never happened
- Influence **political opinions** with fake news

## How to Question What You See and Hear

When encountering content online, ask yourself:

1. **Where is it from?** Is the source trustworthy?
2. **Can I find it elsewhere?** Important news will be covered by multiple sources.
3. **Does it seem too perfect or emotional?** AI content often triggers strong reactions.
4. **Does it make unusual claims?** If something seems unbelievable, it might not be real.
5. **When was it created?** Very recent events may not have reliable reporting yet.

## Tools to Detect AI-Generated Content

### For Text

Look for:
- **Overly perfect writing** with no minor errors
- **Generic descriptions** without specific details
- **Repetitive phrases** or unusual word patterns

Try tools like:
- [Content at Scale AI Detector](https://contentatscale.ai/ai-content-detector/)
- [GPTZero](https://gptzero.me/)

### For Images

Look for:
- **Strange hands or fingers** (AI often creates too many fingers)
- **Unusual details in eyes** (different sizes, unusual reflections)
- **Distorted backgrounds** or objects
- **Weird text** in the image (AI often struggles with text)

Try tools like:
- [TinEye Reverse Image Search](https://tineye.com/)
- [Google Lens](https://lens.google/)

### For Audio and Video

Look for:
- **Unnatural lip movements**
- **Blurry areas** around the face
- **Strange voice patterns** or breathing
- **Inconsistent lighting** or backgrounds

## Interactive Activity: Spot the AI

<div class="quiz-container">
    <p>Can you tell which of these is AI-generated? Click on the one you think was made by AI:</p>
    
    <div class="quiz-option" data-correct="false">
        <img src="images/real-photo.jpg" alt="A real photograph of a person" />
        <p>Photo A</p>
    </div>
    <div class="quiz-option" data-correct="true">
        <img src="images/ai-photo.jpg" alt="An AI-generated image of a person" />
        <p>Photo B</p>
    </div>
    <div class="feedback"></div>
</div>

## When Someone Sends You AI Content

If you receive a suspicious message, video, or audio that claims to be from someone you know:
- **Contact the person directly** through a known, trusted channel
- **Don't respond** to the message itself
- **Be especially careful** if the message asks for money or personal information
- **Report** suspicious content to the platform where you found it

## Case Study: Martha's Experience

Martha received a video call that showed her grandson in distress, saying he was in jail and needed bail money. The voice and face looked like her grandson, but something felt off. Martha:

1. Ended the call
2. Called her grandson's regular phone number
3. Discovered he was at work, not in jail
4. Reported the scam to the FTC

Martha's smart response protected her from an AI-powered impersonation scam.

## Key Takeaways

- AI can create very realistic fake content
- Always verify information from multiple trusted sources
- Be especially cautious about emotional appeals or urgent requests
- When in doubt, contact people directly through known phone numbers or emails
- AI technology is constantly improving, so staying cautious is important
