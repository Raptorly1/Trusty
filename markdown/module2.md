## Remember!

**Never rush to respond** to urgent messages. Legitimate organizations will give you time to think.

**When in doubt, check it out** – call the organization directly using a phone number from their official website (not from the message you received).

**Talk to someone you trust** before sending money or personal information to anyone you don't know well.
