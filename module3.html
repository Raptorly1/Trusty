                        <p>Deepfakes are videos, images, or audio recordings that have been digitally altered using artificial intelligence (AI) to make them look or sound like someone else, often in a very convincing way.</p>

                        <h3>How Fake News Spreads</h3>
                        <p>False information often travels faster and reaches more people than accurate information. This happens because:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Shocking or surprising stories tend to get more attention</li>
                            <li>Social media platforms make it easy to share content with just one click</li>
                            <li>Many people share articles based only on the headline, without reading the full story</li>
                            <li>Some websites create fake news specifically to generate advertising revenue from clicks</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Tips for Spotting Fake Content</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Check the source:</strong> Is it from a reputable news organization? Does the website look professional?</li>
                            <li><strong>Look for unusual web addresses:</strong> Fake news sites often use addresses that sound like real news sources but with slight differences</li>
                            <li><strong>Check the date:</strong> Sometimes old stories are reshared as if they're new</li>
                            <li><strong>Read beyond the headline:</strong> Headlines can be misleading; read the full article</li>
                            <li><strong>Look for multiple sources:</strong> If a story is true, multiple reputable news sources will likely report it</li>
                            <li><strong>Check your emotional reaction:</strong> If a story makes you feel very angry or surprised, be extra careful to verify it</li>
                            <li><strong>Look for unusual features in videos:</strong> Deepfakes often have unnatural eye movements, strange skin tones, or audio that doesn't quite match lip movements</li>
