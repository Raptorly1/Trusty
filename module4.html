                        <h3>What a Secure Website Looks Like</h3>
                        <p>When you visit a website, especially one where you might enter personal information or make a purchase, it's important to make sure it's secure. Here's how to check:</p>
                        
                        <div class="example">
                            <h4>Signs of a Secure Website:</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>HTTPS in the address:</strong> The website address should start with "https://" (not just "http://"). The "s" stands for "secure".</li>
                                <li><strong>Lock symbol:</strong> Look for a padlock icon next to the website address at the top of your browser.</li>
                                <li><strong>Privacy policy:</strong> Legitimate websites usually have a privacy policy that explains how they handle your information.</li>
                                <li><strong>Contact information:</strong> Reputable websites typically provide a physical address, phone number, or email contact.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                        
                        <p>These security features indicate that the information you send to the website (like credit card numbers or passwords) is encrypted, which means it's scrambled so others can't read it during transmission.</p>

                    <div class="module-section">
                        <h3>How to Check if a Website is Real</h3>
                        <p>Sometimes scammers create fake websites that look almost identical to real ones. Here's how to tell if a website is authentic:</p>
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Check the web address carefully:</strong> Scammers often use addresses that are similar to real ones but with small changes, like "amaz0n.com" instead of "amazon.com" or "paypa1.com" instead of "paypal.com".</li>
                            <li><strong>Look for poor grammar and spelling:</strong> Legitimate companies proofread their websites; lots of errors can be a red flag.</li>
                            <li><strong>Search for reviews:</strong> Do a quick search for the website name plus "reviews" or "scam" to see what others say about it.</li>
                            <li><strong>If it's a store, check return and refund policies:</strong> Legitimate online stores have clear policies about returns and refunds.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                        <h3>Avoiding Sketchy Ads and Links</h3>
                        <p>Advertisements and links can sometimes lead to unsafe websites or download unwanted software. Be cautious of:</p>
                        
                        <div class="warning">
                            <h4>Warning Signs of Risky Ads or Links:</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Too-good-to-be-true offers:</strong> "You've won a free iPhone!" or "Make $5,000 a week from home!"</li>
                                <li><strong>Countdown timers:</strong> "Offer expires in 5:00 minutes!"</li>
                                <li><strong>Flashing, blinking, or overly animated ads:</strong> These are designed to grab your attention and get you to click impulsively.</li>
                                <li><strong>Misleading buttons:</strong> Buttons that say "Download Now" or "Play" when you're not trying to download or play anything.</li>
                                <li><strong>Ads disguised as computer messages:</strong> "Your computer is infected!" or "Update required!"</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                        
                        <p>When in doubt, don't click! Instead, if you're interested in an offer, go directly to the company's official website by typing their web address in your browser.</p>

                        <h3>Pop-ups and Malware Tricks</h3>
                        <p>Pop-ups are windows that suddenly appear when you're browsing. While some are legitimate, many try to trick you into downloading harmful software (malware) or providing personal information.</p>
                        
                        <div class="example">

                                <li><strong>"Your computer is infected" warnings:</strong> These claim your device has viruses and you need to call a number or download software to fix it.</li>
                                <li><strong>"You've won" messages:</strong> These claim you've won a prize and need to click to claim it.</li>
                                <li><strong>"Your software is outdated" alerts:</strong> These try to get you to download fake updates that are actually malware.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Don't click inside the pop-up:</strong> Even clicking the "X" or "Close" button can sometimes trigger malware.</li>
                            <li><strong>Close the browser window:</strong> If a pop-up won't go away, try closing the entire browser window.</li>
                            <li><strong>On Windows:</strong> Press Alt + F4 to close the current window.</li>
                            <li><strong>On Mac:</strong> Press Command + W to close the current tab or Command + Q to quit the browser.</li>
                            <li><strong>If all else fails:</strong> Restart your computer.</li>
