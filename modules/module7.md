### **🔄 Keep Your Software and Devices Updated**

#### **🛠 Why Updates Matter**

Software updates aren’t just about new features, they often **fix security problems** that hackers can use to get into your system.

Think of it like this: if your front door lock was broken, you’d fix it quickly. Software updates are like **fixing digital locks** that guard your private information.

#### **💡 How to Stay Updated**

* **Mac:** Apple Menu \> System Preferences \> Software Update

**On a Phone or Tablet:**

* **iPhone/iPad:** Settings \> General \> Software Update

* **Android:** Settings \> System \> System Update or About Phone \> System Updates

**Set Up Automatic Updates:**

### **📱 Be Careful with App Downloads**

#### **✅ Only Download from Trusted Sources**

* **iPhones/iPads:** Use the Apple App Store

### **⏳ Be Skeptical of Urgency**

* “We need money right now\!”

* “You’ve won — but only if you act fast\!”

* “You’ll be arrested if you don’t respond\!”

#### **✅ The “Wait and Verify” Rule**

When something feels rushed or scary:
