### **Module 1: The Basics – What is Online Safety?**

#### **What does it mean to be safe online?**

Being safe online means protecting yourself when you use the internet, whether you're on a phone, tablet, or computer.

Just like you lock your front door at night or avoid talking to strangers in public, there are simple things you can do to stay safe when you’re online.

Online safety helps you:

* **Avoid scams** that try to trick you out of money or personal information

* **Keep your personal details private** (like your name, birthday, or credit card number)

* **Feel confident** and in control when reading news, emails, or using apps

Unfortunately, the internet has some bad actors, people who pretend to be someone they’re not, create fake websites, send tricky emails, or share false news stories. Their goal? To confuse or trick you.

These scams can lead to:

* **Losing money** from fake offers or donations

* **Identity theft**, where someone pretends to be you using your private details

* **Trust issues**, where it becomes hard to know what’s real and what’s not

But don’t worry, **Trusty** is here to guide you, step-by-step.

Once you learn what to look out for and practice a few smart habits, staying safe online becomes much easier, and a lot less stressful\!
