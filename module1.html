                        <p>Being safe online means knowing what to trust and what to avoid when you use a phone, tablet, or computer.</p>
                        <p>Just like you lock your front door to stay safe at home, you also need a few smart habits to stay safe on the internet!</p>
                        
                        <div class="example">
                            <p>Clara uses her phone to read the news and look at pictures of her grandkids. One morning, she got a text message that looked like it came from her bank. It said her account was locked and told her to click a link.</p>
                        </div>

                        <p>Clara wasn't sure what to do. The message looked real, and it made her worried. She almost clicked the link, but decided to show her son first.</p>
                        <p>Her son looked at the message and gently said, "Mom, I'm really glad you asked. This is a scam. The bank would never text you like that."</p>
                        
                        <div class="warning">
